# DwebVR

The decentralized web needs a decentralized filesystem, but more importantly it also needs killer use-cases and applications for driving mass adoption. VR/AR requires a ton of data and speed, especially as hardware becomes more capable. Having any lag in the system can induce motion sickness in players quickly. Together there's a great match: distributed systems like IPFS can help build a resilient backbone that the Metaverse needs to scale and meet the performance demands of spatial computing.
